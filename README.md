# Facial Emotion Detection

(group project) built a tensorflow model with keras

tested both MLP and CNN neural networks for detecting emotions in a human face

attempt to improve accuracy (human accuracy is about 65%, and we think machines can do better!)

# techniques
- one-hot encoding
- facial landmarks
- euclidean distances

# notes
- model using distances between facial landmarks performed better than raw pixel inputs
- CNN worked better for understanding spatial relation when compared with the MLP model
