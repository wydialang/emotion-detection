# emotiondetect

(first project) built a tensorflow model with keras

tested both MLP and CNN neural networks on detecting emotions in a human face

attempt to improve accuracy (human accuracy is about 65%)

# notes
- model using distances between facial landmarks performed better than raw pixel inputs
